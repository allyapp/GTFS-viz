# GTFS-viz
We like to help cities understand their publict transportation system. For this we take the [GTFS dataset](https://github.com/allyapp/GTFS-viz/tree/master/data) of Mexico City and build software around the data to make it more accesiable. 

There are two options to make the data more accesible and give a city insights in it's system:

### 1. Visualize the entire system
Show how the different modes of transport interact over time. To get an inspiration have a look at [this example](http://tracker.geops.ch/?z=14&s=1&x=-8235743.4976&y=4971840.9526&l=transport).

### 2. Query specific parts of the system
Give the city the option to query specific parts of their system (e.g. Bus 210) and retrify information. To get an inspiration have a look at [this example](https://transit.land/playground/).
Visualizing the resutls of the query is not necessary required. An API endpoint could be enough.

### General instructions
* The solution should work independently of the given GTFS dataset.
* Use this repository to build your solution.
* Don't forget the instructions for testing and running the code.
